description: >-
  Weekly casual meetup - as ever feel free to bring/work on projects,
  learn/experiment with new things, for advice and to chat with other members.


  There's an ongoing project or two (LED Matrix, setting up some kit, exploring
  options for sensor networks etc.), the Paul's 3D Printer may be back and
  anything else people bring along.


  See you there!
