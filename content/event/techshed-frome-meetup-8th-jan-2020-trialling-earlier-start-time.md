title: 'Techshed Frome Meetup [8th Jan 2020] - Trialling Earlier Start Time '
description: >-
  Happy New Year!


  We're trialling an earlier start time of 6pm to give people who can't make the
  later start time a chance to get involved - not all of us can make it from 6,
  so we're still running until 9pm.


  We hope to see existing members and new people for 2020 & make some  amazing
  stuff together.
