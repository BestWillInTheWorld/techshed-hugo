  # No Smoke Without Buyers


  ## Building Up


  We're still finding our way a bit on how much to lead sessions, but we're
  looking to make sure we have basic kit available for all - just turn up and
  get something practical to work with and importantly to give people an
  opportunity to make interesting and useful kit for the space.


  I had a bit of a plan to make some more electronics with moving parts -
  brought in my soldering iron and stuff - then we talked through what next
  sessions might be and planned out what kit we’d need to make a proper session
  where we didn’t totally depend on what kit people brought in.


  We put together a buy list, went ahead and organised the purchases and
  delivery (we probably want a kit list on the site at some point).


  ## Some Practical Stuff


  Getting past the admin bit (which moves us forward a fair chunk), we managed
  to generate a little bit of smoke at the end - soldering up a couple of
  [DigiStump](http://digistump.com/products/1) USB microcontrollers (pretty
  capable, interesting form-factor with USB communication on device & 3rd part
  clones are generally less than £1.50 on eBay etc.)
