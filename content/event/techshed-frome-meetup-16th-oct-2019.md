  Weekly casual meetup - as ever feel free to bring/work on projects,
  learn/experiment with new things, for advice and to chat with other members.

  Discover Frome, connected electronics, web dev and maybe some cyber security
  chat - plus whatever you're working on.

  A few more new faces this week, which is great to see.


  Great atmosphere with really interesting conversations had, and practical work
  going on - one LED Matrix project fixed, a different LED Matrix died, but it's
  all.


  Kinetic art/physical mirrors came up - here's a couple of links of anyone's
  interested:

  ## A couple of project notes




  ### Proogressive Web Apps


  At site point we're likely to be putting together a PWA ([Progressive Web
  App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)) for [Discover
  Frome](https://www.discoverfrome.co.uk/)




  ### Sensor Networks/Pollution Monitoring


  We're going to continue working with programmable electronics as part of an
  effort to get people up to speed for a pollution monitoring project.  


  We're likely to try out some different ways to get the data from sensors etc.
  and have been in contact with [Air Apparent in
  Bristol](https://airapparentuk.wordpress.com/), looking at using some proven
  sensor designs like this one created by [Luftdaten](https://luftdaten.info/)
  in Germany.
