title: 'Techshed Frome Meetup [4th Dec 2019]'
description: >-
  Weekly casual meetup - as ever feel free to bring/work on projects,
  learn/experiment with new things, for advice and to chat with other members.


  Still got the pollution sensor ongoing - our particulate sensor isn't giving
  any readings, so (in cases it's a hardware issue) I've ordered another one for
  this week.
