title: 'September Sparks - Techshed Frome Meetup [25th Sept 2019]'
description: >-
  Weekly open/casual meetups for making, networking & general collab.


  Wednesdays 7-9pm, Welshmill Hub, Frome.


  We now have some digital electronics kit for members to work with in the space
  - planning to get people intoroduced to Arduino this week to show how simple
  it is to get started with interactive electronics.        


  The idea is to get everyone a up to speed, then move on to connected devices. 


  This should give us a decent base for collab on up-comming community projects
  around environmental monitoring and interactive widgets for the space.

  ### Digital Electronics


  > We're going to be walking through some basics of digital electronics using
  Arduino - a simple microcontroller allowing you to get to grips with the
  basics of controlling electronics with code.


  > Many people see electronics intimidating or some kind of magic...


  > We want to create some useful/interesting interactive items for the Techshed
  to help people to get past that and see how simple interactive devices can be,
  so they can create things of their own.
