description: |-
    Weekly open/casual meetups for making, networking & general collab.

    Wednesdays 7-9pm, Welshmill Hub, Frome.

    We now have some digital electronics kit for members to work with in the space - planning to get people intoroduced to Arduino this week to show how simple it is to get started with interactive electronics.        

    The idea is to get everyone a up to speed, then move on to connected devices. 

    This should give us a decent base for collab on up-comming community projects around environmental monitoring and interactive widgets for the space.
