title: 'September Sparks - Techshed Frome Meetup [25th Sept 2019]'
description: >-
  Weekly open/casual meetups for making, networking & general collab.


  Wednesdays 7-9pm, Welshmill Hub, Frome.


  We now have some digital electronics kit for members to work with in the space
  - planning to get people intoroduced to Arduino this week to show how simple
  it is to get started with interactive electronics.        


  The idea is to get everyone a up to speed, then move on to connected devices. 


  This should give us a decent base for collab on up-comming community projects
  around environmental monitoring and interactive widgets for the space.
