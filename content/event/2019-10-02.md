title: 'Techshed Frome Meetup [2nd Oct 2019]'
description: >-
  As ever, these are open sessions, so you can bring kit or ideas in software,
  data, electronics etc. to discuss, work on, get advice or just bring yourself
  and see what's going on.


  For a bit of structure, were going to continue working with some of the
  Electronics kit we've bought for the space, with the aim of getting people
  over the first hurdle into electronics and connected devices.
