## A SHED AWAITS YOU

Sheds are friendly places created by people who like doing stuff - and it is often easier to get stuff done with the help, support and encouragement of others. <br>
Come along to one of the sheds and see what’s happening. 
<br><br>
You can join in, start doing that project you have wanted to do - or maybe help others with your knowledge, experience, tools, materials or just your support. <br>
You would be surprised at how little you need to know to be the most knowledgeable person in the room
<br><br><br>
