## Trello Boards

### [Skills](https://trello.com/b/W4NvovnG/skills-matrix)

In order to highlight what the community has to offer, we've started a "skills matrix".  

The intention is to provide a simple way to find out what skills are being shared at the sessions and what you might like to learn or contribute.

We have grander plans in this area for connecting people with collaborators and project ideas, so watch this space.



### [Problems](https://trello.com/b/8EllkZqi/techshed-problem-board)

This is the starting place for longer-running projects we might carry out as a group.

### [Admin](https://trello.com/b/z23NtQ2M/techshed-todo)

This board keeps track of some of the admin tasks still left to do for the shed.
