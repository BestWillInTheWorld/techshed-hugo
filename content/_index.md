    <p>

    Through a combination of regular weekly sessions, community projects and
    public events we aim to raise technical resources in Frome.

    </p>

    <p>

    To enable this, satisfying the simple need for somewhere to go, share and
    create with interesting, like-minded people is our starting point. 

    </p>

    <p> 

    Through collaboration and focus on real-world projects, we'e building depth
    of skills and understanding among members, as well as broadening awareness
    of the opportunities and pitfalls of technology among the wider community.

    </p>

    <p>

    When we bring different minds together, we believe awesome things will
    happen!
