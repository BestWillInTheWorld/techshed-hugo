      Weekly open/casual meetups for making, networking & general collab.
      Wednesdays 7-9pm, Welshmill Hub, Frome.

      We've got hold of a bunch of digital electronics kit - planning to get
      people intoroduced to Arduino this week to show how simple it is to get
      started with interactive electronics.

      The idea is to get everyone a foundation, then move on to connected
      devices. This should give us a decent base for collab on up-comming
      community projects around environmental monitoring and interactive widgets
      for the spce.
