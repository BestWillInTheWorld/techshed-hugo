      We've got hold of a bunch of digital electronics kit - planning to get people intoroduced to Arduino this week to show how simple it is to get started with interactive electronics.

      The idea is to get everyone a foundation, then move on to connected devices.
      This should give us a decent base for collab on up-comming community projects around environmental monitoring and interactive widgets for the spce.
