      Weekly open/casual meetups for making, networking & general collab.


      Wednesdays 7-9pm, Welshmill Hub, Frome.


      We now have some digital electronics kit for members to work with in the
      space - planning to get

      people intoroduced to Arduino this week to show how simple it is to get

      started with interactive electronics.        


      The idea is to get everyone a up to speed, then move on to connected

      devices. 


      This should give us a decent base for collab on up-comming

      community projects around environmental monitoring and interactive widgets

      for the space.
